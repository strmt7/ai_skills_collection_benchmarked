## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Iteratively reviews and fixes Claude Code skill quality issues until they meet standards. Runs automated fix-review cycles using the skill-reviewer agent. Use to fix skill quality issues, improve skill descriptions, run automated skill review loops, or iteratively refine a skill. Triggers on 'fix my skill', 'improve skill quality', 'skill improvement loop'. NOT for one-time reviews—use /skill-reviewer directly.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-skill-improver-skills-skill-improver-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/skill-improver/skills/skill-improver/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `agent-infrastructure-and-skill-creation-beir-retrieval`: Evaluate retrieval workflows across datasets.
- `agent-infrastructure-and-skill-creation-swe-bench-lite`: Patch real GitHub issue tasks and verify with repository tests.
- `agent-infrastructure-and-skill-creation-common-crawl-warc`: Retrieve, parse, and cite web-scale documents.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
