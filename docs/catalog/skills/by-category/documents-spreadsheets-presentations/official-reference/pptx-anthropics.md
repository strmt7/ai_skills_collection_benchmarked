## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Use this skill any time a .pptx file is involved in any way — as input, output, or both. This includes: creating slide decks, pitch decks, or presentations; reading, parsing, or extracting text from any .pptx file (even if the extracted content will be used elsewhere, like in an email or summary); editing, modifying, or updating existing presentations; combining or splitting slide files; working with templates,.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-anthropics-skills-skills-pptx-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/2c7ec5e78b8e5d43ea02e90bb8826f6b9f147b0c/skills/pptx/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `documents-spreadsheets-and-presentations-sec-edgar-companyfacts`: Extract and reconcile financial facts from filings.
- `documents-spreadsheets-and-presentations-enron-email`: Classify, summarize, and route real email threads.
- `documents-spreadsheets-and-presentations-stackoverflow-survey`: Analyze survey data and produce reproducible charts.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
