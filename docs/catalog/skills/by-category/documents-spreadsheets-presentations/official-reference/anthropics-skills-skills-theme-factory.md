## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Toolkit for styling artifacts with a theme. These artifacts can be slides, docs, reportings, HTML landing pages, etc. There are 10 pre-set themes with colors/fonts that you can apply to any artifact that has been creating, or can generate a new theme on-the-fly.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-anthropics-skills-skills-theme-factory-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/2c7ec5e78b8e5d43ea02e90bb8826f6b9f147b0c/skills/theme-factory/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `documents-spreadsheets-and-presentations-sec-edgar-companyfacts`: Extract and reconcile financial facts from filings.
- `documents-spreadsheets-and-presentations-enron-email`: Classify, summarize, and route real email threads.
- `documents-spreadsheets-and-presentations-stackoverflow-survey`: Analyze survey data and produce reproducible charts.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
