## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Discovers available Azure OpenAI model capacity across regions and projects. Analyzes quota limits, compares availability, and recommends optimal deployment locations based on capacity requirements. USE FOR: find capacity, check quota, where can I deploy, capacity discovery, best region for capacity, multi-project capacity search, quota analysis, model availability, region comparison, check TPM availability. DO NOT.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-microsoft-skills-github-plugins-azure-skills-skills-microsoft-foundry-models-deploy-model-capacity-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/microsoft/skills/blob/a2c05249c4a20103dd954ca702467aa328aac031/.github/plugins/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/models/deploy-model/capacity/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `cloud-azure-and-microsoft-sdks-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.
- `cloud-azure-and-microsoft-sdks-opentelemetry-demo`: Debug telemetry across microservices.
- `cloud-azure-and-microsoft-sdks-sec-edgar-companyfacts`: Extract and reconcile financial facts from filings.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
