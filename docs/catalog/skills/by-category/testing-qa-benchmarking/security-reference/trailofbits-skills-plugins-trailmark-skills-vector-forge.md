## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the source description or path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Source description: Mutation-driven test vector generation. Finds implementations of a cryptographic algorithm or protocol, runs mutation testing to identify escaped mutants, then generates new test vectors that deliberately exercise the uncovered code paths. Compares before/after mutation kill rates to prove vector effectiveness. Use when generating cryptographic test vectors, measuring Wycheproof coverage gaps, finding escaped.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-trailmark-skills-vector-forge-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/trailmark/skills/vector-forge/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `testing-qa-and-benchmarking-swe-bench-lite`: Patch real GitHub issue tasks and verify with repository tests.
- `testing-qa-and-benchmarking-owasp-benchmark`: Find and classify vulnerability test cases.
- `testing-qa-and-benchmarking-local-omero-compose-workflows`: Validate OMERO deployment, plugin, upload/import, and monitoring workflows.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
- Add an executable validator or helper script so the workflow has objective checks.
