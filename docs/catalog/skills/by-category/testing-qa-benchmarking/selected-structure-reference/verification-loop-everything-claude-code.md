Selected ref: `v1.10.0`; commit `846ffb75da9a`

## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: A comprehensive verification system for Claude Code sessions.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-affaan-m-everything-claude-code-agents-skills-verification-loop-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/846ffb75da9a5f4e677d927af1ad4a1951652267/.agents/skills/verification-loop/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `testing-qa-and-benchmarking-swe-bench-lite`: Patch real GitHub issue tasks and verify with repository tests.
- `testing-qa-and-benchmarking-owasp-benchmark`: Find and classify vulnerability test cases.
- `testing-qa-and-benchmarking-local-omero-compose-workflows`: Validate OMERO deployment, plugin, upload/import, and monitoring workflows.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add an executable validator or helper script so the workflow has objective checks.
