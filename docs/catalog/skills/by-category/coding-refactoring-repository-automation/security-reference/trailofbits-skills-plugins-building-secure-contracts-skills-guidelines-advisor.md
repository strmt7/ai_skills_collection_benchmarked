## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Smart contract development advisor based on Trail of Bits' best practices. Analyzes codebase to generate documentation/specifications, review architecture, check upgradeability patterns, assess implementation quality, identify pitfalls, review dependencies, and evaluate testing. Provides actionable recommendations.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-building-secure-contracts-skills-guidelines-advisor-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/guidelines-advisor/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `coding-refactoring-and-repository-automation-swe-bench-lite`: Patch real GitHub issue tasks and verify with repository tests.
- `coding-refactoring-and-repository-automation-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.
- `coding-refactoring-and-repository-automation-opentelemetry-demo`: Debug telemetry across microservices.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
