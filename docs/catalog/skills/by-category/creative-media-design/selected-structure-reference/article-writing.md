## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Write articles, guides, blog posts, tutorials, newsletter issues, and other long-form content in a distinctive voice derived from supplied examples or brand guidance. Use when the user wants polished written content longer than a paragraph, especially when voice consistency, structure, and credibility matter.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-affaan-m-everything-claude-code-agents-skills-article-writing-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/846ffb75da9a5f4e677d927af1ad4a1951652267/.agents/skills/article-writing/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `creative-media-and-design-coco-captions`: Evaluate image understanding and visual QA tasks.
- `creative-media-and-design-air-defense-android-benchmarks`: Run startup, gameplay, and visual QA benchmark scenarios.
- `creative-media-and-design-nyc-tlc-trip-records`: Clean, aggregate, and explain large real trip data.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
