## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the source description or path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Source description: Applies Anthropic's official brand colors and typography to any sort of artifact that may benefit from having Anthropic's look-and-feel. Use it when brand colors or style guidelines, visual formatting, or company design standards apply.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-anthropics-skills-skills-brand-guidelines-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/2c7ec5e78b8e5d43ea02e90bb8826f6b9f147b0c/skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `creative-media-and-design-coco-captions`: Evaluate image understanding and visual QA tasks.
- `creative-media-and-design-air-defense-android-benchmarks`: Run startup, gameplay, and visual QA benchmark scenarios.
- `creative-media-and-design-nyc-tlc-trip-records`: Clean, aggregate, and explain large real trip data.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
