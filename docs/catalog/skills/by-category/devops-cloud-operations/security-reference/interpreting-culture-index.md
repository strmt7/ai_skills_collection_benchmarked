## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Interprets Culture Index (CI) surveys, behavioral profiles, and personality assessment data. Supports individual profile interpretation, team composition analysis (gas/brake/glue), burnout detection, profile comparison, hiring profiles, manager coaching, interview transcript analysis for trait prediction, candidate debrief, onboarding planning, and conflict mediation. Accepts extracted JSON or PDF input via OpenCV.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-culture-index-skills-interpreting-culture-index-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/culture-index/skills/interpreting-culture-index/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `devops-cloud-and-operations-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.
- `devops-cloud-and-operations-opentelemetry-demo`: Debug telemetry across microservices.
- `devops-cloud-and-operations-local-omero-compose-workflows`: Validate OMERO deployment, plugin, upload/import, and monitoring workflows.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
