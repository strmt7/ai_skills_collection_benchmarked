Selected ref: `v2.37.1`; commit `eb20fb0dcb0b`

## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Complete mass spectrometry analysis platform. Use for proteomics workflows feature detection, peptide identification, protein quantification, and complex LC-MS/MS pipelines. Supports extensive file formats and algorithms. Best for proteomics, comprehensive MS data processing. For simple spectral comparison and metabolite ID use matchms.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-k-dense-ai-scientific-agent-skills-scientific-skills-pyopenms-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills/blob/eb20fb0dcb0b1dadaa3db2737188f0755bbc4770/scientific-skills/pyopenms/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `science-research-and-data-analysis-cellxgene-census`: Query and analyze single-cell expression data.
- `science-research-and-data-analysis-chembl`: Retrieve molecular bioactivity records.
- `science-research-and-data-analysis-ome-ngff-samples`: Read and validate multiscale microscopy data.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
- Add an executable validator or helper script so the workflow has objective checks.
