## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Conduct comprehensive, systematic literature reviews using multiple academic databases (PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, Semantic Scholar, etc.). This skill should be used when conducting systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses, research synthesis, or comprehensive literature searches across biomedical, scientific, and technical domains. Creates professionally formatted markdown documents and PDFs with verified.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-k-dense-ai-scientific-agent-skills-scientific-skills-literature-review-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills/blob/eb20fb0dcb0b1dadaa3db2737188f0755bbc4770/scientific-skills/literature-review/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `science-research-and-data-analysis-cellxgene-census`: Query and analyze single-cell expression data.
- `science-research-and-data-analysis-chembl`: Retrieve molecular bioactivity records.
- `science-research-and-data-analysis-ome-ngff-samples`: Read and validate multiscale microscopy data.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
- Move long background material into references/ to keep SKILL.md concise.
