## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Searches and explores Burp Suite project files (.burp) from the command line. Use when searching response headers or bodies with regex patterns, extracting security audit findings, dumping proxy history or site map data, or analyzing HTTP traffic captured in a Burp project.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-burpsuite-project-parser-skills-burpsuite-project-parser-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/burpsuite-project-parser/skills/burpsuite-project-parser/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-benchmark`: Find and classify vulnerability test cases.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-juice-shop`: Run safe local security workflows against a known vulnerable app.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
