## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the source description or path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Source description: Identifies error-prone APIs, dangerous configurations, and footgun designs that enable security mistakes. Use when reviewing API designs, configuration schemas, cryptographic library ergonomics, or evaluating whether code follows 'secure by default' and 'pit of success' principles. Triggers: footgun, misuse-resistant, secure defaults, API usability, dangerous configuration.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-sharp-edges-skills-sharp-edges-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/sharp-edges/skills/sharp-edges/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-benchmark`: Find and classify vulnerability test cases.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-juice-shop`: Run safe local security workflows against a known vulnerable app.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
- Add an executable validator or helper script so the workflow has objective checks.
