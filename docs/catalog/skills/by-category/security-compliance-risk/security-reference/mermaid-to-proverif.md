Selected ref: `default-branch HEAD`; commit `e8cc5baf9329`

## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Translates Mermaid sequenceDiagrams describing cryptographic protocols into ProVerif formal verification models (.pv files). Use when generating a ProVerif model, formally verifying a protocol, converting a Mermaid diagram to ProVerif, verifying protocol security properties (secrecy, authentication, forward secrecy), checking for replay attacks, or producing a .pv file from a sequence diagram.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-trailmark-skills-mermaid-to-proverif-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/trailmark/skills/mermaid-to-proverif/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-benchmark`: Find and classify vulnerability test cases.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-juice-shop`: Run safe local security workflows against a known vulnerable app.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
- Add an executable validator or helper script so the workflow has objective checks.
