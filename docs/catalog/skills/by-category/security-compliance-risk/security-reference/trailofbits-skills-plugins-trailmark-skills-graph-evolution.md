## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the source description or path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Source description: Compares Trailmark code graphs at two source code snapshots (git commits, tags, or directories) to surface security-relevant structural changes. Detects new attack paths, complexity shifts, blast radius growth, taint propagation changes, and privilege boundary modifications that text diffs miss. Use when comparing code between commits or tags, analyzing structural evolution, detecting attack surface growth,.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-trailofbits-skills-plugins-trailmark-skills-graph-evolution-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/blob/e8cc5baf9329ccb491bfa200e82eacbac83b1ead/plugins/trailmark/skills/graph-evolution/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-benchmark`: Find and classify vulnerability test cases.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-owasp-juice-shop`: Run safe local security workflows against a known vulnerable app.
- `security-compliance-and-risk-kubernetes-examples`: Validate manifests and operational runbooks.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
