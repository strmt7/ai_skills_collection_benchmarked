## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: GPU-accelerate Python code using CuPy, Numba CUDA, Warp, cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, KvikIO, cuCIM, cuxfilter, cuVS, cuSpatial, and RAFT. Use whenever the user mentions GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA acceleration, or wants to speed up NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, scikit-image, NetworkX, GeoPandas, or Faiss workloads. Covers physics simulation, differentiable rendering, mesh ray casting, particle systems (DEM/SPH/fluids),.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-k-dense-ai-scientific-agent-skills-scientific-skills-optimize-for-gpu-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills/blob/eb20fb0dcb0b1dadaa3db2737188f0755bbc4770/scientific-skills/optimize-for-gpu/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `game-mobile-and-visual-qa-air-defense-android-benchmarks`: Run startup, gameplay, and visual QA benchmark scenarios.
- `game-mobile-and-visual-qa-coco-captions`: Evaluate image understanding and visual QA tasks.
- `game-mobile-and-visual-qa-owasp-juice-shop`: Run safe local security workflows against a known vulnerable app.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
- Move long background material into references/ to keep SKILL.md concise.
