## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Multi-source deep research using firecrawl and exa MCPs. Searches the web, synthesizes findings, and delivers cited reports with source attribution. Use when the user wants thorough research on any topic with evidence and citations.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-affaan-m-everything-claude-code-agents-skills-deep-research-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/846ffb75da9a5f4e677d927af1ad4a1951652267/.agents/skills/deep-research/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `search-retrieval-and-web-automation-common-crawl-warc`: Retrieve, parse, and cite web-scale documents.
- `search-retrieval-and-web-automation-beir-retrieval`: Evaluate retrieval workflows across datasets.
- `search-retrieval-and-web-automation-ms-marco`: Rank passages and support answer extraction.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
