## Use

Load this skill only when the task matches the catalog summary or source path; read SKILL.md first and then load referenced resources on demand.

## Scope

Catalog summary: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Verification

Static benchmark results are reported in `docs/benchmark-results.md`. Runtime claims require a validated artifact.

Assigned scenarios:

- `skill-proof-anthropics-skills-skills-frontend-design-skill-md`: Use the immutable source file https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/2c7ec5e78b8e5d43ea02e90bb8826f6b9f147b0c/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md as the fixture and prove the agent can understand when and how to use the skill.
- `search-retrieval-and-web-automation-common-crawl-warc`: Retrieve, parse, and cite web-scale documents.
- `search-retrieval-and-web-automation-beir-retrieval`: Evaluate retrieval workflows across datasets.
- `search-retrieval-and-web-automation-ms-marco`: Rank passages and support answer extraction.

Improvement notes:

- Keep provenance and selected ref visible so agents can verify the source before use.
- Maintain at least 3 real workflow benchmark scenarios before treating the skill as deployable.
- Add agents/openai.yaml or equivalent metadata when the skill is intended for OpenAI/Codex-style listings.
