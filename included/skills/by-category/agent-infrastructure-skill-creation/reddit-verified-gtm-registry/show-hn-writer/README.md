Draft a Show HN post (title + body) that follows Hacker News norms: specific, honest, first-person, no marketing. Generates three title variants and a complete body, then runs a Gemini review to catch HN anti-patterns before you post.

## What It Does

- Reads your project context (from README or your answers)
- Drafts three Show HN title variants in different formats
- Writes a 150-350 word body following HN community norms
- Uses Gemini to flag marketing language, vague descriptions, or other HN anti-patterns
- Runs a self-QA checklist before presenting output
- Includes submission notes (timing, first-comment strategy, resubmission rules)

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Gemini API key (optional) | Automated draft review for HN anti-patterns | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |

The skill works without Gemini: it runs the manual self-QA checklist instead.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add GEMINI_API_KEY if you want automated review (optional)
```

## How to Use

From a README:
```
"Write a Show HN post for my project"
"Help me launch on Hacker News"
"Draft a Show HN for the project in this repo"
```

With explicit context:
```
"Write a Show HN post for [project name]: [what it does]. I built it because [reason]."
```

For a specific title format:
```
"Write a Show HN title for my CLI tool that converts JSON to TypeScript interfaces"
```

## Show HN Title Formats

| Format | Example | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Product-First | `Show HN: Datasette – Instantly publish SQLite databases to the web` | Single-function tools |
| Outcome-Focused | `Show HN: Jitsi – Group video calls without an account` | Tools replacing something painful |
| Technical-Angle | `Show HN: Bun – JavaScript runtime built in Zig` | Dev tools where the implementation matters |
| Experiment | `Show HN: Ink – React for command-line apps` | Projects challenging a convention |

## What Makes a Good Show HN Post

**Title:** 60-80 characters. Starts with "Show HN:". En dash separator. No adjectives.

**Body:** First-person. 150-350 words. At least one technical detail. Honest about limitations. Ends with an invitation for feedback, not a CTA.

**What kills HN posts:**
- Vague titles ("Show HN: I built a thing for developers")
- Marketing adjectives ("fast", "simple", "powerful")
- Asking for upvotes
- Body that reads like a product page
