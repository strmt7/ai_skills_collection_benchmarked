Analyze this blog cover image and verify if it meets the following CRITICAL requirements:
1. TEXT ACCURACY: Does the image contain the exact text: "${title}"? It must be legible and spelled correctly.
2. LOGO PRESENCE: ${hasLogo ? 'The image MUST contain the requested company logo.' : 'No specific logo was required.'}
3. IMAGE INTEGRITY: Is the image clear and not obviously corrupted or garbled?
4. UNWANTED ELEMENTS: Are there any redundant, misplaced, or entirely irrelevant third-party icons or UI elements that don't fit the strict title context? (If yes, the image is INVALID).

RELAXED RULES (DO NOT FAIL FOR THESE):
- Colored text is ALLOWED and ENCOURAGED if it matches the brand.
- Brand-colored logos are ALLOWED.
- Minimalist, subtle UI elements are allowed ONLY if they perfectly match the specific requested context.
- The background does NOT have to be pure white; subtle gradients or brand colors are acceptable.

Return a JSON object with:
- "isValid": boolean (true only if CRITICAL requirements are met)
- "issues": string (empty if isValid is true, otherwise describe what is wrong)
