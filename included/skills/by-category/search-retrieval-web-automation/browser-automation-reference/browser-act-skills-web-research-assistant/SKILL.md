# Web Research Assistant

This skill leverages **BrowserAct API** to provide powerful web research capabilities. When primary web access is restricted or blocked, it automatically searches the internet to find and extract relevant information, ensuring your research tasks are completed successfully.

## ✨ OpenClaw & Claude Code Optimized

**🚀 Works Seamlessly with OpenClaw and Claude Code**

| Platform | Status | Installation |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **OpenClaw** | ✅ **Highly Recommended** | Copy to `~/.openclaw/skills/` |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ **Highly Recommended** | Native skill support |
| **OpenCode** | ✅ Fully Supported | Copy to `~/.opencode/skills/` |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Fully Supported | Copy to `~/.cursor/skills/` |

**Why This Skill?**
- 🎯 **Purpose-built for OpenClaw and Claude Code**
- 🔄 **Auto-recovery** when web access is restricted
- 🌐 **Global access** - no IP or geoblocking issues
- 💰 **Cost-effective** - saves token usage

## 🎯 When to Use

**Web Access Restricted? No Problem!**

Use this skill when:
- 🔒 Target websites block AI assistant access
- 🌍 Geographic restrictions limit content access
- 🔐 Paywalls prevent data extraction
- ⏱️ Need quick supplemental information
- 📊 Research requires multiple data sources
- 🔍 Need current information beyond cached data

## 🔑 API Key Guidance

Before running, check the `BROWSERACT_API_KEY` environment variable. If not set, request the API key from the user:

**Required Message**:
> "Please provide your BrowserAct API Key from [BrowserAct Console](https://www.browseract.com/reception/integrations) to enable web research capabilities."

## 🛠️ Input Parameters

Configure research based on your needs:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | - | Research topic or question |
| `engine` | string | google | Search engine (google, bing, duckduckgo) |
| `max_results` | number | 10 | Results to retrieve (1-50) |
| `content_type` | string | all | Content filter (all, news, articles, data) |
| `time_range` | string | past_month | Time filter (anytime, past_day/week/month/year) |
