Walk into every sales or business development call prepared. Give the skill a company name and it runs targeted research, synthesizes a 1-page brief, and optionally saves it to Notion.

## What It Does

- Runs 6-8 targeted Tavily searches covering company overview, recent news, tech stack, product, competitors, funding, and contact background
- Synthesizes results into a structured 1-page brief using Gemini
- Every claim cites a source URL from the research
- Optionally saves the brief to a Notion database
- Handles low-data companies by marking gaps instead of inventing content

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Tavily API key | Company research | app.tavily.com, API Keys |
| Gemini API key | Brief synthesis | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |
| Notion token (optional) | Saving briefs | notion.so/my-integrations |

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in:
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` (required)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required)
- `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` (optional, for saving briefs)

## How to Use

Basic brief with company only:

```
"Prepare me for a meeting with Stripe next Tuesday"
"Generate a meeting brief for Vercel"
"Research Acme Corp before my call tomorrow"
```

With contact and meeting type:

```
"Prepare a discovery call brief for Linear. I'm meeting with the VP Engineering, Jordan Lee."
"Create a pre-call brief for Notion. Demo call on April 20."
```

Save to Notion:

```
"Generate a meeting brief for Figma and save it to Notion"
```

## Brief Sections

|---------|---------|
| Company Snapshot | What they do, size, funding stage, HQ |

| Competitive Context | Who they compete with and how |
| Talking Points | Because/mention/to formula, 3-5 bullets |
| Open Questions | Company-specific discovery questions |

## Output Format

One page, under 400 words. Every claim has a source URL. Talking points follow the format: "Because [finding from research], mention [point] to [goal]."
