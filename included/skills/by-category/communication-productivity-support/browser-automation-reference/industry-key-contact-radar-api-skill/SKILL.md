# Industry Key Contact Radar

## 📖 Brief
This skill provides a one-stop contact discovery service using BrowserAct's Industry Key Contact Radar API template. It extracts structured contact details directly from search results across various platforms, including profile URLs, names, introductions, and company associations. Simply input an industry, result limit, target site, and job title to receive clean, actionable contact data.

## ✨ Features
1. **No hallucinations, ensuring stable and accurate data extraction**: Pre-set workflows avoid AI generative hallucinations.
2. **No CAPTCHA issues**: No need to handle reCAPTCHA or other verification challenges.
3. **No IP restrictions or geo-blocking**: No need to handle regional IP restrictions or geofencing.
4. **Faster execution**: Tasks execute faster compared to purely AI-driven browser automation solutions.
5. **Extremely high cost-efficiency**: Significantly reduces data acquisition costs compared to AI solutions that consume massive amounts of tokens.

## 🔑 API Key Guide
Before running, you must check the `BROWSERACT_API_KEY` environment variable. If it is not set, do not take other actions first; you should ask and wait for the user to provide it.
**Agent must inform the user**:
> "Since you haven't configured the BrowserAct API Key yet, please go to the [BrowserAct Console](https://www.browseract.com/reception/integrations) to get your Key."

## 🛠️ Input Parameters
Agent should flexibly configure the following parameters based on user needs:

1. **industry (Industry)**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The industry or field to search for contacts.
   - **Example**: `Browser automation`, `E-commerce`, `Healthcare`
   - **Default**: `Browser automation`
   - **Required**: Yes

2. **Datelimit (Max Items)**
   - **Type**: `number`
   - **Description**: Maximum number of records to extract. The default value is recommended for the first run.
   - **Example**: `10`
   - **Default**: `10`

3. **site (Target Site)**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The social platform or website to search on.
   - **Example**: `facebook.com`, `linkedin.com`, `github.com`
   - **Default**: `facebook.com`
   - **Required**: Yes

4. **Job_Title (Job Title)**
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Description**: The specific role or job title of the target contact.
   - **Example**: `founder`, `CEO`, `marketing manager`
   - **Default**: `founder`
   - **Required**: Yes

## 🚀 Invocation Method
The Agent should execute the following independent script to achieve "one command gets results":

```bash
# Example
python -u ./scripts/industry_key_contact_radar_api.py "Browser automation" 10 "facebook.com" "founder"
```

### ⏳ Running Status Monitoring
Since this task involves automated browser operations, it may take a long time (several minutes). The script will **continuously output status logs with timestamps** while running (e.g., `[14:30:05] Task Status: running`).
**Agent guidelines**:
- While waiting for the script to return results, please keep an eye on the terminal output.
- As long as the terminal continues to output new status logs, it means the task is running normally. Do not misjudge it as a deadlock or unresponsiveness.
- If the status remains unchanged for a long time or the script stops outputting without returning a result, only then consider triggering the retry mechanism.

## 📊 Data Output
After successful execution, the script will parse and print the results directly from the API response. The results include:
- `url`: Direct link to the contact's public profile
- `name`: The name of the contact or profile title
- `Introduction`: A brief introduction or bio description of the contact
- `Company`: The company or organization associated with the contact

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Retry
During script execution, if errors occur (such as network fluctuations or task failure), the Agent should follow this logic:

1. **Check the output content**:
   - If the output **contains** `"Invalid authorization"`, it means the API Key is invalid or expired. At this point, **do not retry**, but guide the user to recheck and provide the correct API Key.
   - If the output **contains** `"concurrent"` or `"too many running tasks"` or similar concurrency limit messages, it means the concurrent task limit for the current subscription plan has been reached. **Do not retry**; guide the user to upgrade their plan.
     **Agent must inform the user**:
     > "The current task cannot be executed because your BrowserAct account has reached the limit of concurrent tasks. Please go to the [BrowserAct Plan Upgrade Page](https://www.browseract.com/reception/recharge) to upgrade your subscription plan and enjoy more concurrent task benefits."
   - If the output **does not contain** the above error keywords but the task fails (e.g., output starts with `Error:` or returns empty results), the Agent should **automatically try to run the script once more**.

2. **Retry limit**:
   - Automatic retry is limited to **once**. If the second attempt still fails, stop retrying and report the specific error message to the user.

## 🌟 Typical Use Cases
1. **Lead Generation**: Finding public profiles for founders and CEOs in target industries.
2. **Talent Acquisition**: Sourcing growth leaders and key roles for recruiting.
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Identifying key personnel in competing organizations.
4. **Professional Networking**: Gathering profiles for industry connections.
5. **Market Intelligence**: Collecting URLs and names of industry leaders.
6. **Cross-Platform Discovery**: Searching target profiles on specific sites like LinkedIn or GitHub.
7. **B2B Outreach**: Finding decision-makers and extracting contact details.
8. **Brand Marketing**: Locating marketing managers in a specific field.
9. **Sales Prospecting**: Building lists of specific job titles across industries.
10. **Targeted Job Title Search**: Compiling a list of target roles on specific social sites.
