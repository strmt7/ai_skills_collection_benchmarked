Watch subreddits for people describing the exact problem you solve. Score each post for ICP relevance. Draft a helpful, non-spammy reply for every high-signal match.

## What It Does

- Reads your ICP definition from docs/icp.md (or asks 3 questions to build it)
- Searches specified subreddits for posts matching your pain point phrases
- Scores each candidate post 1-5 using Gemini (how clearly does this person have the problem you solve?)
- Drafts a helpful reply for every post scoring 4 or 5, in the correct mode (vent, how-do-you, or tool recommendation)
- Enforces a hard rule: replies never name your product unless the post explicitly asks for tool recommendations
- Saves the full report to docs/reddit-intel/YYYY-MM-DD.md

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose | How to Set Up |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Gemini API key | Relevance scoring and reply drafting | aistudio.google.com, Get API key |
| Reddit credentials (optional) | Higher rate limit (60 RPM vs 10 RPM) | reddit.com/prefs/apps, create a script app |

Reddit credentials are optional. The skill uses Reddit's public JSON endpoints by default, which require no setup and support 10 RPM. That is enough for most monitoring sessions.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required)
- Reddit credentials (optional, see OAuth Upgrade below)

## How to Use

First run (no docs/icp.md yet):
```
"Monitor Reddit for my ICP signals"
"Scan subreddits for people who need my product"
```

The skill asks 3 questions to build your ICP definition and saves it to docs/icp.md.

Subsequent runs (docs/icp.md exists):
```
"Check Reddit for buying signals"
"Run the Reddit ICP monitor for this week"
"Find ICP posts from the last month"
```

Specify a time window:
```
"Monitor Reddit for ICP signals from the last 24 hours"
"Check Reddit for this month's pain point posts"
```

## Output

Each run produces a report with:
- All subreddits monitored and time window
- Each high-signal post: title, URL, upvotes, signal quote, matched keyword, post type
- A drafted reply for each match (2-5 sentences, mode-appropriate)
- A list of subreddits that returned 0 results (for tuning)

Reports are saved to `docs/reddit-intel/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Reply Modes

The skill classifies each post and drafts in the appropriate mode:

| Mode | Post Type | Can Name Product? |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Mode 1 | Venting / frustration | Never |
| Mode 2 | "How do you handle X?" | Never |
| Mode 3 | "What tool does X?" | Yes, with one alternative |

## Choosing Good Subreddits

**Where to monitor (people describing problems):**
- r/devops, r/ExperiencedDevs, r/sysadmin: engineers asking operational questions
- r/startups, r/SaaS, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong: founders and operators venting about scaling
- r/sales, r/marketing: GTM practitioners asking how others handle things

**Where not to monitor:**
- Topic subreddits (r/programming, r/MachineLearning): discussions, not pain points
- Your product's own subreddit: not monitoring your own community
- Broad consumer subreddits: not your B2B ICP

## OAuth Upgrade

If you need more than 10 RPM (large subreddits or frequent runs):

1. Go to reddit.com/prefs/apps and create a "script" app
2. Note: app approval may take several days as of late 2025
3. Fill in REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET, REDDIT_USERNAME, REDDIT_PASSWORD in .env

With OAuth, the skill fetches a Bearer token at session start and uses the `oauth.reddit.com` endpoint for 60 RPM.
